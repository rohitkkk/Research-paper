# Research paper on "The Psychology of Color in Marketing"

## Research Methodology and Completion Process
### Survey Design and Data Collection:

A structured survey was designed with 24 questions, divided into three sections: demographic details, image-based color preferences, and non-image-based questions on purchasing decisions.
The survey was distributed online using Google Forms, targeting participants aged 14-40 across different age groups, genders, and educational backgrounds.
Data was collected over two weeks, gathering responses from 200 participants.
### Hypotheses Formulation and Testing:

Three hypotheses were developed to analyze the relationship between color preferences and purchasing behavior, emotional responses to color schemes, and the impact of color trends on purchasing habits.
Statistical tests such as the Chi-Square test, Spearmanâ€™s correlation, and ANOVA were used to evaluate the hypotheses.
### Data Analysis:

Quantitative data was analyzed using statistical tools like frequency distribution and cross-tabulation.
Qualitative insights were derived from open-ended responses about emotional associations with colors.
New features, such as age groups and color scheme preferences (neutral, pop, dark), were incorporated to analyze variations.
### Interpretation and Findings:

Results showed demographic differences in color preferences, with younger participants favoring pop colors and older participants associating neutral colors with comfort.
While certain colors evoked strong emotional responses, these did not necessarily translate to significant purchasing behavior differences.
### Limitations and Conclusion:

The study acknowledged the limitations of convenience sampling and a small sample size.
The findings emphasized the importance of combining color strategies with emotional and psychological triggers for effective marketing.
